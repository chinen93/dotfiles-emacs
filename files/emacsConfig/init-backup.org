Backup is a important part of editting text. Because most of the times
I make some mistakes and having the possibility to revert to a cleaner
state is gold.

* Set Default Directory
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

The default directory to store backups is the file's directory that is
being editted. However, for me, it makes the directory kind of
messy. So to tidy it up a bit I put everything in ="~/.emacs.d/backups"=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let* ((filename ".emacs.d/backups")
         (homeFilename (concat "~/" filename)))

    (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,homeFilename)))

    (when (and (boundp 'my/home-folder)
               (file-directory-p my/home-folder))
      (setq backup-directory-alist
            `(("." . ,(concat my/home-folder filename))))))

#+END_SRC

* TODO How to name the auto-saved backup files
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b46630ef-a0a3-4ec3-8d47-104c057070cb
:END:

Set transform to apply to buffer file name before making auto-save file name.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let* ((filename ".emacs.d/auto-save-list/")
         (homeFilename (concat "~/" filename)))

    (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,homeFilename t)))

    (when (and (boundp 'my/home-folder)
               (file-directory-p my/home-folder))
      (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
            `((".*" ,(concat my/home-folder filename) t)))))

#+END_SRC

* Configurations

:END:

Copy the file to the backup's folder.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t)

#+END_SRC


When making a backup create a name with a numeric suffix like:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Organizador.org.~1~
  Organizador.org.~2~
  Organizador.org.~4~
#+END_SRC

Create numeric suffix when backing up files. I make this way because I can see what was changed between edits. And It doens't take much space in disk.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq version-control t)

#+END_SRC


But don't keep too many versions. Just some.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; How many backups to keep
  (setq kept-new-versions 2)
  (setq kept-old-versions 2)

  ;; Delete the others
  (setq delete-old-versions t)

#+END_SRC
